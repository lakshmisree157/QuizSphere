# Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

## Introduction to AI
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

AI systems are designed to simulate human cognitive functions such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. The field encompasses various subfields including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

## Machine Learning Basics
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions.

Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each type serves different purposes and applications.

### Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data
2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds patterns and structures in unlabeled data without predefined outputs
3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties

## Neural Networks
Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information and can learn complex patterns.

These networks are organized in layers, with each layer performing specific computations. The input layer receives data, hidden layers process it, and the output layer produces results.

### Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.

Deep learning has revolutionized fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition by achieving state-of-the-art performance on various tasks.
